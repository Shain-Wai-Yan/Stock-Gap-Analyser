# Gap Trading Strategy Guide

## Achieving 80%+ Win Rate on Gap Trades

This guide explains how to use the Gap Analysis Tool effectively to achieve a high win rate on gap fill trades.

## Understanding Gap Trading

### What is a Gap?
A gap occurs when a stock opens significantly higher or lower than its previous close, creating a visible "gap" on the chart.

### Why Do Gaps Fill?
Gaps tend to fill because:
1. **Profit Taking**: Early buyers take profits
2. **Value Seekers**: New buyers see opportunity at original levels
3. **Market Makers**: Need to maintain orderly markets
4. **Technical Traders**: Target gap fills as support/resistance

### Gap Types

**1. Breakaway Gap** (Trend Start)
- Gap in direction of new trend
- High volume
- Usually doesn't fill quickly
- **Strategy**: Avoid trading against these

**2. Continuation Gap** (Mid-Trend)
- Gap during strong trend
- Medium volume
- Partial fill possible
- **Strategy**: Trade with caution

**3. Exhaustion Gap** (Trend End)
- Final push before reversal
- Very high volume
- High probability fill
- **Strategy**: Best for gap fill trades

**4. Common Gap** (No Trend Change)
- Gap with no clear catalyst
- Normal volume
- Usually fills within days
- **Strategy**: Highest probability trades

## The 80% Win Rate Strategy

### Filter Criteria (Already in Tool)

**1. Gap Size: 2-8%**
- Too small (< 2%): Not worth the risk/reward
- Too large (> 8%): Lower fill probability, more volatile
- Sweet spot: 3-5% gaps

**2. Volume Ratio > 2x**
- Confirms genuine interest
- Reduces false signals
- Higher ratios = more conviction

**3. Historical Fill Rate > 70%**
- Based on similar past gaps
- Symbol-specific patterns
- Sector averages

**4. Sentiment Score > 0.6**
- Positive news sentiment
- No major catalyst against fill
- Market conditions favorable

**5. Conviction: HIGH**
- All factors align
- Tool calculates automatically
- Focus only on HIGH conviction

### Entry Rules

**For Gap UP (Stock opens higher):**
1. Wait for first 15-30 minutes
2. Look for initial pullback (10-20% of gap)
3. Enter SHORT when:
   - Price shows weakness
   - Volume decreases
   - Below VWAP
   - RSI overbought (if you track it)

**For Gap DOWN (Stock opens lower):**
1. Wait for first 15-30 minutes
2. Look for initial bounce
3. Enter LONG when:
   - Price shows strength
   - Volume confirms
   - Above VWAP
   - RSI oversold

### Exit Rules

**Target: Gap Fill (Previous Close)**
- Take 50% profit at 50% fill
- Take 30% profit at 75% fill
- Let 20% run to full fill

**Stop Loss:**
- Gap UP: 150% of gap size above open
- Gap DOWN: 150% of gap size below open
- Or use tool's risk calculator

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing Formula
```
Position Size = (Account Risk) / (Stop Loss Distance)

Example:
- Account: $50,000
- Risk per trade: 1% = $500
- Entry: $100
- Stop: $108
- Stop distance: $8

Position Size = $500 / $8 = 62.5 shares
```

### Maximum Exposure
- Never risk > 2% per trade
- Max 3 gap positions at once
- Reduce size when conviction is MEDIUM
- Skip LOW conviction entirely

### Correlation Risk
- Avoid multiple gaps in same sector
- Tech stocks often move together
- Diversify across sectors

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Trading Every Gap
❌ Wrong: Trade all gaps > 2%
✅ Right: Only HIGH conviction gaps

### 2. Ignoring Volume
❌ Wrong: Gap size alone determines trade
✅ Right: Volume must confirm the move

### 3. No Stop Loss
❌ Wrong: "It will eventually fill"
✅ Right: Always use stops (150% of gap)

### 4. Holding Overnight
❌ Wrong: Keep position open overnight
✅ Right: Close by EOD or use much wider stops

### 5. Ignoring News
❌ Wrong: Trade based on technicals only
✅ Right: Check news feed in tool

### 6. Overtrading
❌ Wrong: Force trades when no good setups
✅ Right: Wait for HIGH conviction signals

### 7. No Position Sizing
❌ Wrong: Same size for all trades
✅ Right: Adjust based on conviction + risk
